/// Mux selection for the "not from OR gate" input to the XOR gate.
/// The XOR gate in a macrocell contains two inputs,
/// the output of the corresponding OR term from the PLA
/// and a specific dedicated AND term from the PLA.
XorMode
00      *_0     Constant zero, which results in this XOR passing the OR value through
11      _1      Constant one, which results in this XOR inverting the OR value
10      PTC     XOR the OR term with the special product term C
01      PTCB    XNOR the OR term with the special product term C
